# WTDFold: An RNA Secondary Structure Prediction Method based on Wavelet Transform and Deep Learning.
## Abstract
The precise prediction of RNA secondary structures is vital for unlocking their biological functions, yet conventional models face a major performance bottleneck when dealing with complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale features. To bridge this gap, we introduce WTDFold, a cutting-edge deep learning framework. WTDFold fuses the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) into the pipeline of the classic U-Net. By breaking down intricate RNA sequences into multi-resolution frequency components, it vastly empowers the model to capture sharp structural boundaries and long-distance base pairs.

## Prerequisites
--python >= 3.9

--torch == 2.0.0 with cuDNN == 8.5.0 (CUDA == 11.7)

--pytorch_wavelets == 1.3.0

--numpy == 2.4.6

--pandas == 3.0.3

--scikit-learn == 1.8.0

--tqdm == 4.67.1

## Installation
### 1.Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/HpuBioinformatics/WTDFold.git
```
Navigate to the root of this repo and setup the conda environment.

### 2.Use the following command to create the environment.
```
conda env create -f environmnet.yaml
```
### 3.Activate conda environment.
```
conda activate WTDFold
cd WTDFold
``` 

## Usage

### Training
You can train our model using pre-defined data.
```bash
python train.py --train_files bpRNA
                --val_files bpRNA
                --save_dir ./
                --gpu_id 0
```
Note: save_dir can be user-defined as the destination path for saving the weights directory.
### Evaluating 
We provide the test script for user to evaluate the prediction result using the following command:
```bash
python test.py --test_files bpRNA
               --weight_path ./trian_alldata.pt
               --gpu_id 0 
```
### Predicting
We support two prediction modes depending on your input format: using a FASTA file (fasta_file) or a plain text sequence (raw_seq).
```bash
python predict.py --fasta_file ./data/my_sequences.fasta --weight_path ./trian_alldata.pt --output_dir ./my_results --gpu_id 0
```
```bash
python predict.py --raw_seq "GGGCCCGUAGUCUCAGGGUAAGAGCACACGCUGAAGUGUGUGGGUCGGCAGUUCGAUCCCGCUGCGGCCCACCA" --seq_name "tRNA_example" --weight_path ./trian_alldata.pt --output_dir ./my_results --gpu_id 0
```
Note: fasta_file is the directory for your predictions, which contains the FASTA files to be processed.
